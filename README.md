RFD's note: I believe that instead of one list like this with stuff being split later, it would be best to use a common list:  
--canon words in bold  
--source column lists canon source (with a quote?) or mod/modder (TR for Baan, etc.)  
--if a not-fully-canon word/translation is canon-derived, also include that in notes along with direct source (Sha- from Shashpilamat, etc.)  
--thin column for A/Y note (Ald-Dunmeri/Yan'Dunmeri)  
  
  
Where to get existing stuff?  
--game files, obv  
--MD's notes  
--TR  
--existing Dunmeri language notes - would need very careful picking  
--Safebox' mod
